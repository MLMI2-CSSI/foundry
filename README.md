Foundry is a Python package that simplifies the discovery and usage of machine-learning ready datasets in materials science and chemistry. Foundry provides software tools that make it easy to load these datasets and work with them in local or cloud environments. Further, Foundry provides a dataset specification, and defined curation flows, that allow users to create new datasets for the community to use through this same interface.


# Installation
Foundry can be installed via pip with:

`pip install foundry-ml`

# Example Usage

The Foundry client can be used to access datasets using a `source_id`, e.g. here "_test_foundry_fashion_mnist_v1.1":

```python 
from foundry import Foundry
f = Foundry()
f = f.load("_test_foundry_fashion_mnist_v1.1")
```

This will remotely load the necessary metadata as well as download the data to local storage if it is not already present. To ensure successful data download, have a Globus endpoint [setup](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal) on your machine. Once the data is accessible locally, load the data into the client:

```python 
X, y = f.load_data()
```

The data is then usable:

```python
n_cols = 6
display_shape = (28,28)
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,n_cols)

for i in range(0, n_cols):
    ax[i].imshow(X[i].reshape(display_shape), cmap='gray')
```

This example can be found in `examples/fashion-mnist/`.

### Other uses
To just download the data without loading the additional metadata:

```python
f = Foundry().download("_test_foundry_fashion_mnist_v1.1")
```

While it is strongly recommended to load metadata remotely, it can be done locally with a `foundry_metadata.json` file:

```python 
f = Foundry().from_file()
```

# Using Foundry on Cloud Computing Resources
Foundry works with common cloud computing providers like the NSF sponsored Jetstream and Google Colab. When instantiating the Foundry client, simple add the following arguments to use a compatible authentication flow.

```python 
f = Foundry(no_browser=True, no_local_server=True)
```

When downloading data, add the following argument to download contents by HTTPS. This method may be non-performant for large datasets
```python 
f.download(globus=False)
```

# Documentation
Formal documentation is currently under development. You may see the Foundry documentation thus far [here](https://foundry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?).

## Building the documentation locally
### Instructions for developers
Foundry documentation is built and served by [Read the Docs](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). To run a local build and generate the HTML files on your
local machine, you need to install [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html):
```angular2html
pip install sphinx
```
When you clone the Foundry repo, there should be a `/docs` directory with all the relevant files, including a Makefile and a `/source`
subdirectory.

To generate the build files, from the root of the `/docs` subdirectory run
```
make html
```
Now, under `/docs/build/html` you should find the necessary HTML files. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the documentation.


Between changes to `confy.py` or associated source files, it's good practice to run `make clean` before running `make html`.
