Foundry is a Python package that simplifies the discovery and usage of
machine-learning ready datasets in materials science and chemistry.
Foundry provides software tools that make it easy to load these datasets
and work with them in local or cloud environments. Further, Foundry
provides a dataset specification, and defined curation flows, that
allow users to create new datasets for the community to use through
this same interface.
