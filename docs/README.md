# Getting started with Foundry

![](.gitbook/assets/foundry-purple%20%281%29%20%281%29.png)

## What is Foundry?

Foundry is a Python package that simplifies the discovery and usage of machine-learning ready datasets in materials science and chemistry. Foundry provides software tools that make it easy to load these datasets and work with them in local or cloud environments. Further, Foundry provides a dataset specification, and defined curation flows, that allow users to create new datasets for the community to use through this same interface.

## Installation

Foundry can be installed on any operating system with Python with pip

```text
pip install foundry-ml
```

### Globus

Foundry uses the Globus platform for authentication, search, and to optimize some data transfer operations. Follow the steps below to get set up.

* [Create a free account.](https://app.globus.org) You can create a free account here with your institutional credentials or with free IDs \(GlobusID, Google, ORCID, etc\).
* [Set up a Globus Connect Personal endpoint ](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal)_**\(optional\)**_. While this step is optional, some Foundry capabilities will work more efficiently when using GCP.

## Project Support

This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under NSF Award Number: 1931306 "Collaborative Research: Framework: Machine Learning Materials Innovation Infrastructure".

### Other Support

Foundry brings together many components in the materials data ecosystem. Including MAST-ML, the Data and Learning Hub for Science \(DLHub\), and The Materials Data Facility \(MDF\).

#### MAST-ML
