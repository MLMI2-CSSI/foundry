# Publishing Models

In addition to datasets, you can publish models \(or even individual Python methods\) to Foundry and run them in the cloud!

## Examples

Model publication example notebook coming soon

## Model Types

You can publish any of the following types of models or functions to Foundry:

* [Scikit-Learn models](publishing-models.md#scikit-learn-models)
* [Tensorflow 1 & 2 models](publishing-models.md#tensorflow-1-and-2-models)
* [Keras models](publishing-models.md#keras-models)
* [PyTorch models](publishing-models.md#keras-models)
* [Class methods \(advanced use\)](publishing-models.md#class-methods)
* [Static methods \(advanced use\)](publishing-models.md#static-methods)

### Scikit-Learn models

### Tensorflow 1 & 2 models

### Keras models

### PyTorch models

### Class methods

### Static methods

## Data Types for Inputs and Targets

## Describing Models 

Before you can publish a model, you need to describe it using metadata in compliance with the [DataCite metadata format](https://schema.datacite.org).
