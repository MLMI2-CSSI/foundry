# Publishing Datasets

In order to publish datasets, the datasets must 1) adhere to specified Foundry dataset shapes ([see here](publishing-datasets.md#shaping-datasets)), and 2)  be described with required information ([see here](publishing-datasets.md#describing-datasets)). Together, the dataset shape and description enable researchers to reuse the datasets more easily.

{% hint style="info" %}
When datasets are published you will receive a [Digital Object Identifier (DOI) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital\_object\_identifier)to enable citation of the research artifact
{% endhint %}

## Jupyter Notebook Publishing Guide

We created a notebook that walks you through the publication process. Just fill in the notebook with your data's details and you can publish right from there.

## Shaping Datasets

For a general dataset to be translated into a usable Foundry dataset, it should follow one of the prescribed shapes. It should also be described by a set of `Key` objects, which provides description of the data, and a mapping that allows Foundry to read data into usable Python objects ([see Describing Datasets](publishing-datasets.md#describing-datasets) for more info).&#x20;

### **Tabular Data**

Tabular data should be in a form where columns represent the different keys of the data and rows represent individual entries. For example:

| **feature\_1** | **feature\_2** | **material\_type** | band\_gap |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| 0.10           | 0.52           | 1                  | 1.40      |
| 0.34           | 0.910          | 0                  | 0.73      |
| ...            | ...            | ...                |           |

For this example dataset, the `keys` list could be: &#x20;

```python
"keys": [{
	"key": ["feature_1"],
	"type": "input",
	"units": "",
	"description": "This is feature 1"
},{
	"key": ["feature_2"],
	"type": "input",
	"units": "",
	"description": "This is feature 2"
},{
	"key": ["material_type"],
	"type": "input",
	"description": "This is the material type",
	"classes": ["perovskite", "not perovskite"]
},{
	"key": ["band_gap"],
	"type": "target",
	"units": "eV",
	"description": "This is the simulated band gap in eV"
}]
```

{% hint style="info" %}
`Don't forget to specify the tabular data filename and path in the submitted metadata. This can be done in a split - see the section on` [`Describing Datasets`](publishing-datasets.md#describing-datasets)
{% endhint %}

### Hierarchical Data

Foundry also supports data from hierarchical data formats (e.g., [HDF5](https://www.h5py.org)). In this case, features and outputs can be represented with `/` notation. For example, if the features of a dataset are located in an array stored in `/data/arr1` and `/other_data/arr2` while the outputs are in `/data/band_gaps`, the Key object would be:

```python
"keys": [{
	"key": ["/data/arr1"],
	"type": "input",
	"units": None,
	"description": "This is an array containing input data"
}, {
	"key": ["/other_data/arr2"],
	"type": "input",
	"units": None,
	"description": "This is an another array containing input data"
}, {
	"key": ["/data/band_gaps"],
	"type": "target",
	"units": "eV",
	"description": "This is the simulated band gap in eV"
}]
```

## Describing Datasets

**DataCite Metadata (object):** All datasets can be described using metadata in compliance with the [DataCite metadata format](https://schema.datacite.org). This metadata captures . Many of these capabilities have helper functions in the SDK, to make it easier to match the DataCite schema

**Keys (list\[Key]):** `Key` objects provide a mapping that allows Foundry to read data from the underlying data structure into usable Python objects. Individual `Key` objects have the following properties

* **`key (str) [required]`**A name mapping to a column name (e.g., for csv files) or key within a data structure (e.g., for HDF5 files)
* **`type (str) [required]`** The type of key this entry represents. Currently suported types are _**\["input", "target" ]**_
* **`units (str)[optional]`** The scientific units associated with a key. _Default: None_
* **`description (str)[optional]`** A free text description of the key. _Default: None_
* **`labels (list) (str) [optional]`:** A list of strings mapped to integers in a key column

```python
# An example of keys object

"keys":[{
    "key": ["band_gaps"],
    "type": "target",
    "units": "eV",
    "description": "This is the simulated band gap in eV"
}]
```

**Splits (list\[Split]) \[required]:** `Split`objects provide a way for users to specify which data should be included as test, train, or other user defined splits. Individual `Split` objects have the following properties

* **`type (str) [required]`**A split type, e.g., the Foundry special split types of `train`, `test`,  and`validation`. These special split types may be handled differently than custom split types defined by users.&#x20;
* **`path (str) [required]`** The full filepath to the dataset file or directory that contains the split
* **`label (str)`** A label to assign to this split

```python
"splits": [{
    "type": "train",
		"path": "g4mp2_data.json", # Specify the filename and path of the source file
		"label": "train"           # A text label for the split
}]
```

**short\_name (str) \[required]:** Short name is a unique name associated with this dataset to make loading and .&#x20;

**type (str) \[required]:** The type provides a hint to Foundry on how to map the keys into loading operations. _Options \["tabular","hdf5"]_

## Publishing

{% hint style="info" %}
Before continuing, be sure that you have 1) signed up for a [free Globus account](https://app.globus.org) and 2) [joined this Globus group](https://app.globus.org/groups/cc192dca-3751-11e8-90c1-0a7c735d220a/about).
{% endhint %}

Once your dataset is in the proper shape, and you have created the associated metadata structure, you can publish to Foundry! One example of a complete set of metadata to describe a dataset is shown below.

```python
{
	"splits": [{
		"type": "train",
		"path": "g4mp2_data.json",
		"label": "train"
	}],
	"keys": [{
			"type": "input",
			"key": ["feature_1"],
			"units": "",
			"description": "This is an input"
		},
		{
			"type": "target",
			"key": ["band_gap"],
			"units": "eV",
			"description": "Bandgap of the material"
		}
	],
	"short_name": "my_short_name",
	"data_type": "tabular",
	"task_type": ["supervised"],
	"domain": ["materials science"]
	
}
```

Currently, you can publish any dataset you have stored on a Globus endpoint or Google Drive. In the following, assume your [previously defined metadata](publishing-datasets.md#describing-datasets) are stored in `metadata` :

```python
from foundry import Foundry

# path to the data for HTTPS upload
# NOTE: if uploading via Globus Connect Client, you'll want to specify `globus_data_source` instead 
https_data_path = "~/Documents/data/g4mp2_data.json"

# full title of dataset
title = "Scourtas example bandgap dataset"

# authors to list 
authors = ["A. Scourtas", "B. Blaiszik"]

# shorthand title (optional)
short_name = "example_AS_bandgap"

# affiliations of authors (optional)
affiliations = ["Globus Labs, UChicago"]

# publisher of the data (optional)
publisher = "Materials Data Facility"

# publication year (optional)
publication_year = 2023


f = Foundry()
res = f.publish_dataset(metadata, data_source, title, authors, short_name=short_name))
```

The `publish_dataset()` method returns a result object that you can inspect for information about the state of the publication. For the above publication, `res` would have the format:

```python
{
 'error': None,
 'source_id': '_test_example_bandgap_v1.1',
 'status_code': 202,
 'success': True
}
```

Note that for large datasets, or for datasets that you would like to upload faster than HTTPS allows, you can create a Globus Transfer. Instead of specifying `https_data_path`, use `globus_data_source`:

<pre><code># Globus endpoint URL where your dataset is located
<strong>globus_data_source = "https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=e38ee745-6d04-11e5-ba46-22000b92c6ec&#x26;origin_path=%2Ffoundry%2F_test_blaiszik_foundry_bandgap_v1.2%2F"
</strong></code></pre>

More information about how to get the Globus source URL to the dataset you would like to publish can be found in our [Publishing Guide](https://github.com/MLMI2-CSSI/foundry/blob/main/examples/publishing-guides/dataset\_publishing.ipynb).

{% hint style="success" %}
Once the dataset is submitted, there is a manual curation step required to maintain dataset standards. This will take additional time.
{% endhint %}

## Future Work

* Add support for wildcard key type specifications
* Add example showing how to describe an image-containing folder
