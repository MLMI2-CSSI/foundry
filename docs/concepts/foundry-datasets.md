# Foundry Datasets

Foundry Datasets are comprised of two key components, data and descriptive metadata. In order to make the data easily consumable, data \(consisting of files\) should be assembled following the supported structures. The metadata description allows tracking of high level information \(e.g.,  authors, assoicated institutions, licenses, data location\), and also information on how to operate on the datasets \(e.g., how to load the data, training/test splits\)
