# Examples using Foundry
If you're wondering how to get started with Foundry or want to see it in action, you're in the right place!

Each notebook walks through instantiating Foundry, loading data from Foundry, and working with the data in different ways. Some notebooks also use machine learning models with the data. 

Each folder contains a notebook and `requirements.txt` file. The notebooks can be run locally (using the `requirements.txt`) or in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

If you have any trouble with the notebooks, please check our [documentation](https://ai-materials-and-chemistry.gitbook.io/foundry/v/docs/) or create an issue on the repo.
