# Examples using Foundry
Each folder contains a notebook and `requirements.txt` file. The notebooks can be run locally (using the `requirements.txt`) or in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

Each notebook walks through instantiating Foundry, loading data from Foundry, and working with the data in different ways. Some notebooks also use machine learning models with the data. 

If you have any trouble with the notebooks, please check our [documentation](https://ai-materials-and-chemistry.gitbook.io/foundry/v/docs/) or create an issue on the repo.
