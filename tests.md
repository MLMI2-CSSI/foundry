_NOTE: These tests are still in development, and should not be expected to properly cover all test cases yet._

## Foundry Tests

This directory contains the tests for the `materials_foundry` package.

### Running the tests

Python 3 must be installed. Go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download Python 3. Pytest must also be installed. To do this, run `pip install pytest`. After Pytest is installed, the tests can be executed by running `pytest` in this directory.

### About the tests

These tests cover the basic and advanced functionality of the `materials_foundry` package. They test each function to check that operations succeed with expected values, error with invalid values, and respect parameters appropriately.
